# Life under water

The game was built as part of an assignment in a computer game development course.

The purpose of the assignment is building components and writing scripts:

1. **Oscillator component**: The fish in **red**, **pink** and **blue** colors demonstrate the use of the Oscillator component in different locations, different speeds and different distance ranges.

2. **Rotator component**: The **starfish** demonstrates to us the use of this component and creates the rotation of the star around itself.

3. **Beat component**: The **balloonfish** demonstrates the use of this component and creates an effect simulating a beating heart by increasing and decreasing it.

4. **Hide component**: The **green** fish demonstrates the component to us. The fish can be hidden by pressing the 'H' button on the keyboard, and unhiding by pressing and holding the 'H' button on the keyboard.
